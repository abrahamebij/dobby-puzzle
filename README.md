## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)
- Appwrite instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abrahamebij/dobby-puzzle.git
   cd dobby-puzzle
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

   ```env
   APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
   DATABASE_ID=your_database_id
   LEADERBOARD_EASY_ID=your_easy_collection_id
   LEADERBOARD_HARD_ID=your_hard_collection_id
   APPWRITE_ENDPOINT="https://<region>.cloud.appwrite.io/v1"
   ```

4. Run the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Leaderboard Caching

- **Server-side caching:**
  Leaderboard data is cached in memory for 1 minute to reduce Appwrite calls.

- **Client-side caching:**
  The client stores leaderboard data in `sessionStorage` to speed up reloads.
  After an update (e.g., submitting a new score), the cache is automatically cleared to fetch fresh data.
